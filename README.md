## What is Url Quick Short

Most url shortening sites have browser plugins that are able to shorten urls for you which is nice. What happens though if you in a browser that doesn't have the plugin or what happens if you copy the url from your browser, close the browser and now want to use that link in another app like maybe on social media or an email but still want to track clicks on the url. Well traditionally you would now open your browser, paste in the link and then click on the handy url shorten plugin to get a short link and then go back to where you were to paste in that link.

With Url Shorten you can use a shortcut key to automatically shorten links that are in your clipboard. By doing this you lose less context of what you were doing. Because Url Quick Short parses your clipboard it will detect multiple urls as shorten all of them for you instead of you needing to replace them one by one.
